# Script to get FNA-based games
# ready to run on OpenBSD
##################
# Requirements:
#
# - SDL2 library that identifies as 'Linux' rather than 'OpenBSD'
#   (needs to be compiled this way; patch to recognize OpenBSD in
#   progress upstream)
# - mono (package in ports marked as BROKEN, but compiles on amd64
#   if /usr/ports is mounted with wxallowed)
##################
# Usage:
#
# fnaify <.exe binary>
#
# call it from the folder where the .exe file is located
##########

####
# 1. replace all occurences of 'linux' in .config files (dllmap) with 'linux,freebsd,openbsd,netbsd'
#    (this won't be needed after patched fna rolled out)
#    - will try to use sed or awk
#    - maybe unified config for all use cases can be created

####
# 2. remove linux libraries in lib and lib64 folders

####
# 3. drop openbsd library package in lib and lib64 folders with names changed to linux equivalents
#
#    the library package contains
#			->	libSDL2-2.0.so.0
#			->	libSDL2_mixer-2.0.so.0
#			->	libmono-2.0.so.1
#			->	libogg.so.0
#			->	libopenal.so.1
#			->	libmojoshader.so... (not available in OpenBSD packages)
#			->	libtheora.so.0
#			->	libtheoradec.so.1
#			->	libtheoraplay.so
#			->	libvorbis.so.0
#			->	libvorbisfile.so.3

###
# 4. copy wrapper script template into current folder
#    - calls mono

###
# 5. enter correct name of .exe into wrapper script

###
# 6. rename wrapper script based on .exe name and set executable bit
