# Script to get FNA-based games
# ready to run on OpenBSD
##################
# Requirements:
#
# - SDL2 library that identifies as 'Linux' rather than 'OpenBSD'
#   (needs to be compiled this way; patch to recognize OpenBSD in
#   progress upstream)
# - mono (package in ports marked as BROKEN, but compiles on amd64
#   if /usr/ports is mounted with wxallowed)
##################
# Usage:
#
# fnaify <launch script>
#
##########
# TODO:
# - [[ ... ]] vs. [ ... ]
